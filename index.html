      Branding is my favorite part of design. A thoughtful and consistent brand elevates the customer's experience, connects you with your target audience and helps you reach your business goals.
      After 6 years working in design agencies I realized, that you don’t necessarily need an office to construct unique and strategic brands. Luckily I can take my creativity and experience wherever I go – which leads us to Atlas of Elsewhere, a space where I combine my two passions: Design & Travel.
